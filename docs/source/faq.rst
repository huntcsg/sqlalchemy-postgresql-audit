FAQ

**Q: Is this library production ready?**

A: While this is being used in a number of small projects, it is not yet battle tested software. Use at your own risk.

**Q: Should I trust these audit tables for my bank/financial database?**

A: Probably not? The author does not have particular experience with the permission and change management requirements of such systems. This library should be great for low to medium throughput in non-adversarial scenarios, where a "best effort" changelog is what we are after, not a fraud-proof audit trail.
